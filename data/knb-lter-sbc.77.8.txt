      Data on abundance, size and fishing pressure of California spiny
      lobster (Panulirus interruptus) are collected along the mainland
      coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Spiny lobsters are an
      important predator in giant kelp forests off southern California.
      Two SBC LTER study reefs are located in or near the California
      Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Naples and
      Isla Vista, both established as MPAs on 2012-01-01. MPAs provide a
      unique opportunity to investigate the effects of fishing on kelp
      forest community dynamics. Sampling began in 2012 and is ongoing.
    
        
      This dataset contains two tables. 1) Abundance and size data
      collected annually by divers in late summer before the start of
      the fishing season at five SBC LTER long term kelp forest study
      sites: two within MPAs (Naples and Isla Vista) and three outside
      (Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk and Carpinteria). 2) Fishing pressure, as
      determined by counting the number of commercial trap floats. Data
      are collected every two to four weeks during the lobster fishing
      season (October to March) at nine sites along the mainland, eight
      of which are also SBC LTER long-term kelp forest study reefs.

      The number and sizes of spiny lobster are recorded by divers in
      four 60 x 5 m (300 m2 total) lobster
      transects that are associated with each permanent SBC LTER kelp
      forest community survey transect.
    
            
      Data on the abundance and size of the California spiny lobster,
      Panulirus interruptus, are collected annually
      in late summer at five sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Isla
      Vista, Mohawk and Naples) along the mainland coast of the Santa
      Barbara Channel. Two of these sites (Naples and Isla Vista) were
      designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in January 2012. The
      abundances of algae, invertebrates and fish have been monitored at
      these sites since 2001 in replicate 40 m x 2 m permanent SBC LTER
      transects. Although lobsters are counted in these transects, their
      density is not high enough to obtain reliable estimates of
      abundance. Therefore, the additional surveys were initiated in
      2012, which encompass a much larger sampling area and focus
      exclusively on lobster.

      Observers count surface floats which mark baited wire traps used
      by the commercial fishery in depths less than 15 m, in defined
      areas of coastline.
    
            
      The commercial fishery for the California spiny lobster
      (Panulirus interruptus) involves the use
      baited wire traps deployed on the bottom in rocky habitats and
      marked with surface floats (one trap per float). The fishing
      season lasts from October to March. The majority of fishing occurs
      in depths < 15 m. Fishing pressure by the commercial trap
      fishery is estimated at nine mainland areas, eight of which are
      SBC LTER kelp forest study sites. Two sites, Naples and Isla
      Vista, became marine protected areas (MPA) in January 2012.
      Fishing pressure is recorded by counting the number of traps in
      defined areas of coastline every two to four weeks during the
      fishing season (October to March). Lobster trap surveys began in
      October 2012.

          The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
